is any of it real? i mean, look at this, look at it! a world built on fantasy! synthetic emotions in the form of pills! psychological warfare in the form of advertising! mind altering chemicals in the form of food! brainwashing seminars in the form of media! controlled isolated bubbles in the form of social networks. real? you want to talk about reality? we haven't lived in anything remotely close to it since the turn of the century! we turned it off, took out the batteries, snacked on a bag of gmos, while we tossed the remnants into the ever expanding dumpster of the human condition. we live in branded houses, trademarked by corporations, built on bipolar numbers, jumping up and down on digital displays, hypnotizing us into the biggest slumber mankind has ever seen. you'd have to dig pretty deep, kiddo, before you can find anything real. we live in a kingdom of bullshit, that even you have lived in for far too long. so don't tell me about not being real: i'm no less real than the fucking beef patty in your big mac. as far as you are concerned, elliot, i am very real. we are all together now, whether you like it or not.

it came from the world’s first computer – the mark 1 – a room-size maze of electromechanical circuits built in 1944 in a lab at harvard university. the computer developed a glitch one day, and no one was able to locate the cause. after hours of searching, a lab assistant finally spotted the problem. it seemed a moth had landed on one of the computer’s circuit boards and shorted it out. from that moment on, computer glitches were referred to as bugs.

Plaintext:
the solution had taken a terrific toll. the restless turning of the mind tormented by a puzzle, the preoccupation at meals, the insomnia, the sudden wakening at midnight, the pressure to succeed because failure could have national consequences, the despair of the long weeks when the problem seemed insoluble, the repeated dashings of uplifted hopes, the mental shocks, the tension and the frustration and the urgency and the secrecy all converged and hammered furiously upon his skull. he collapsed in december.
