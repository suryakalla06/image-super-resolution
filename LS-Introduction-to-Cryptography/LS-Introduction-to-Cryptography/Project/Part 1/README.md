# The Final Project

## Part 1 - Vigenère Cracker

Write a script to input a Vigenère-encrypted ciphertext and print the plaintext and key. Find out how to perform cryptanalysis on the Vignère cipher using Google or elsewhere.

### Constraints
The input ciphertext will only contain lower case letters, spaces and punctuations. The spaces and punctuations are not encrypted. The key length would be less than or equal to 12 characters. You may use Python, C or C++ to write your script.

### Submission instruction
Create a file `script.py`/`script.c`/`script.cpp` which solves the challenge. Create a README file with clear instructions on how to execute your script.

### Running Instructions
Enter the ciphertext in the file input.txt and then run the python file to get a file output.txt which will contain the plaintext and the key.
